/*
In Go, when you declare a map variable without initializing it, such as `var m map[string]string`,
the variable `m` is initialized with the zero value for a map, which is `nil`.
This means that `m` does not refer to a valid map and does not have an associated memory allocation.

When you initialize an empty map using `var dictionary = map[string]string{}`,
it creates a new map and assigns it to the `dictionary` variable.
In this case, `dictionary` is a valid map with an associated memory allocation,
and it does not have a `nil` value. Therefore, accessing or modifying `dictionary`
will not lead to a runtime panic.

To summarize:

* `var m map[string]string` initializes `m` as a map variable with the zero value, which is `nil`. It does not have an associated memory allocation for the map.
* `var dictionary = map[string]string{}` initializes `dictionary` as a map variable and allocates memory for an empty map. It does not have a `nil` value and is ready to be used without causing a runtime panic.

By properly initializing the map using either a composite literal or the `make` function,
you ensure that the variable refers to a valid map with allocated memory,
avoiding runtime errors when interacting with the map.
